          <p style={{ margin: "1em 0" }}>
            However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no
            known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you
            should generally be fine as long as you don‚Äôt use any plugins that
            implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are
            safe to use!
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "0 0 1em" }}>
            Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting
            disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use
            any client mods (not exclusive to Plexcord), just to be safe

          <p>
            Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Plexcord in a

            To see if this is the case for you, try temporarily disabling all
            themes and your QuickCSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that indeed fixes the lagging, you‚Äôll have to figure out which
            theme / part of your QuickCSS is causing the lag. Just slowly remove
            parts of it until it doesn‚Äôt lag anymore.

          <p>
            Discord tries to protect you from getting scammed by
            &quot;hiding&quot; your token when you open DevTools, which means it
            deletes it from storage and only keeps it in memory in order to make
            it harder to obtain.
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "1em 0" }}>
            If you now close discord before closing DevTools again, your token
            will not be saved anywhere anymore and as a consequence you will be
            logged out
          </p>
          <p style={{ margin: "0 0 1em" }}>
            Solution: Close DevTools before closing discord or better yet enable
